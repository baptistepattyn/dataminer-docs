# DataMiner Objects Tool

The DataMiner Objects Tool addresses the need for **finding, viewing, and interacting with DataMiner objects**. With an interactive Automation script, it allows you to define a combination of filters to query the DataMiner System for any of the following objects:

- Reservation (i.e. booking) instances
- DOM instances
- Resources
- Profile parameters
- Profile definitions
- Tickets
- Service definitions

You can then manually fine-tune the result of the query, view the selected objects as JSON objects, or even delete selected objects.

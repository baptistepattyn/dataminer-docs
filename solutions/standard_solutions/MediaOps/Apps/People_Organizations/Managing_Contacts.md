# Managing contacts

The *People Overview* page serves as the application's landing page. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering a different perspective on your contacts.

You can switch between the *Overview* and *List* tabs by clicking *Overview* and *List* in the header bar of the *People Overview* page.

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics**, including the top 5 individuals in multiple teams, the most available skills, the number of contacts, deprecated contacts, and drafts, and the five most recently added contacts. This tab gives you a quick view of important information.

- The *List* tab provides an **overview of all contacts**, along with their state, email address, skill, experience level, and organization name. This tab allows you to access and review contact details in one centralized location. It also provides an efficient way to [filter through the list of contacts](#searching-within-the-list-of-contacts) based on the provided contact information.

  To obtain more information about a specific contact, click the ![Details](~/user-guide/images/PO_Details.png) button in the corresponding row of the list.

# MediaOps applications

> [!NOTE]
> We are working on adding more applications to this section soon, so check back for updates frequently.

The MediaOps low-code apps are categorized into two main groups:

- MediaOps Planning: These apps enable you to plan, track, schedule, and monetize the resources used to provide customer services. They offer task-focused tools to efficiently manage planning and scheduling for your facility.

- MediaOps Live: These apps enable you to manage and optimize live media operations. They offer tools for real-time control, monitoring, and visualization of workflows.

- **Percentage RPD Offline**: Calculated. The percentage of RPDs that are in an offline state.

  Status returned by smart PHY: v1/smartphycache/rpd/details/active/1.

- **Number CM**: Calculated. The number of cable modems (CMs).

  - Free Memory: OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.48.1.1.1.6.

- **Temperature**: Direct value. The value of the temperature inlet sensor.

  Retrieved from the Temperature Overview table with the filter \*INLET*.

  MIB OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.3.1.3.

- **Last Updated**: Calculated. The last time the element was updated.

  This is the last time the device was fully polled.

- **Status**: Calculated. The current overall operational status of the element.

- **Number MTA**: Calculated. The total number of Multimedia Terminal Adapters (MTAs) for the level.

- **Percentage MTA Offline**: Calculated. The percentage of offline Multimedia Terminal Adapters (MTAs) for the level

- **Number DSG**: Calculated. The total number of set-top gateways (DSGs) for the level.

- **Percentage DSG Offline**: Calculated. The percentage of offline set-top gateways (DSGs) for the level.

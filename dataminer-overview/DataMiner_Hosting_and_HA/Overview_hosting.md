# DataMiner Hosting and High Availability

DataMiner's architecture makes it extremely resilient to all types of failures, also because this architecture has no single point of failure.

Skyline Communications offers the following hosting possibilities, each with its own strengths in term of redundancy and high-availability options:

- [DataMiner as a Service](xref:DaaS_hosting): both the DataMiner nodes and the storage nodes as a service.

- [Self-managed DataMiner nodes with Storage as a Service](xref:DM_selfhosted_and_StaaS).

  ![Hybrid](~/user-guide/images/Hybrid.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> If this is really necessary, you can also host both the DataMiner nodes and the storage nodes yourself. However, this is a complex setup that we do not recommend. See [Self-managed DataMiner nodes and storage nodes](xref:DM_and_storage_selfhosted).

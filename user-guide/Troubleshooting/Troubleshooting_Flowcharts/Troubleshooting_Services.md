START([Service issue])
GetDELT{{Get a .dmimport package. Check the service configuration.}}
HostInfo{{Is the host of the service the same or different from the element? Find this by editing the service/element, where you can find the 'DMA:' setting.}}
DifferentHost([Check the service folder. Check the RemoteService folder.])
SameHost{{"Compare the service impact (alarm property) vs the service state (surveyor/card)."}}
DMAsDisconnected{{Are the DMAs disconnected?}}
SyncCheck{{Run Sync Check tool. Click node to see how. Investigate why the DMAs are disconnected.}}
NotFixed{{"If your issue is not fixed, contact <a href="mailto:support.data-core@skyline.be">support.data-core@skyline.be</a>. Include all gathered information and steps taken."}}
ImpactOrStateIssue{{Service impact or state issue?}}
StateIssue{{Check SLElement service states in Client Test Tool => Diagnostics => DMA. Check __service_'serviceName'.txt logging.}}
ImpactIssue{{Are there duplicate display keys from partially included elements?}}
NotFixedProtocolIssue{{Rows should have unique display keys. Contact the author of your element's connector.}}
IsolateIssue{{Try to isolate and simulate the actual issue. e.g. if the elements are partially included check if it also happens with full inclusion. e.g. does the issue occur on standalone or column parameters?}}
Alarms{{If your issue is not resolved, click this node to go to the alarm flow.}}

# About storage

Each DataMiner System requires its own system data storage. This data storage serves as a repository for configuration data, historical parameter information, and alarm data.

The recommended system data storage architecture is **Storage as a Service** [(STaaS)](xref:STaaS) on dataminer.services. With StaaS, you do not need to maintain the databases yourself, and all the scaling and complexity is taken care of for you.

| **Storage per DMA** | :heavy_check_mark: | | | | | | |

Though this is **not recommended**, you can also host and manage the DataMiner storage yourself. In that case, you will need to configure a **dedicated clustered storage** setup, using a [Cassandra-compatible database service](xref:Cassandra_database) and an [indexing database](xref:Indexing_Database) (i.e. a Search Cluster). While all features are also available with this setup, managing and maintaining it is a great deal **more complex**.

Instead of a dedicated clustered storage setup, older systems often still use **storage per DMA** with [Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra) or (prior to DataMiner 10.3) [MySQL](xref:MySQL_database), but this is **not recommended and not all DataMiner features** are available in such a setup. We highly recommend [migrating to a STaaS setup](xref:STaaS#migrating-existing-data-to-staas) instead. To migrate a MySQL setup to STaaS, you will first need to [migrate to Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra).

> - When the main database is offline, file offloads are used to store write/delete operations. You can configure a limit for the file size of these offloads in the file [DBConfiguration.xml](xref:DBConfiguration_xml).
> - You can also configure [data offloads to a separate database or to files](xref:Offload_database), for example in order to produce all kinds of reports without interfering with the live DataMiner System.

# Verify NATS Migration Prerequisites

This BPA test will verify whether DataMiner is ready to [migrate the NATS management to the BrokerGateway DxM](xref:BrokerGateway_Migration).

It will verify that:

- All DxMs installed on the system that use DataMiner MessageBroker are using at least version 3.0.0. This version is capable of setting up connections using BrokerGateway and can automatically switch its connection configuration at runtime.
- `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Configurations\ClusterEndpoints.json` exists and has *IgnitionValues* filled in for every entry.

This BPA test is available on demand. You can [run it in System Center](xref:Running_BPA_tests) (on the *Agents > BPA* tab). From DataMiner 10.5.0/10.5.2 onwards, it is available by default.<!-- RN 40906 -->

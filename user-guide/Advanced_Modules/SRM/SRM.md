# Service and Resource Management

The DataMiner Service & Resource Management (SRM) framework integrates the [Profiles](xref:The_Profiles_module), [Resources](xref:The_Resources_module), [Services](xref:The_Services_module), and [Bookings](xref:The_Bookings_module) modules, in order to allow you to virtualize your system resources, get an overview of which resources are booked and when, and more.

SRM is usually used along with the standard [Booking Manager app](xref:Booking_Manager_user_interface)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - DataMiner SRM requires [STaaS](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-managed DataMiner storage setup](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures) with Cassandra-compatible database and indexing database, as well as the necessary licenses depending on your SRM use case. For more information, contact the Skyline Sales department.
> - DataMiner SRM log information can be found in the *SLResourceManager*, *SLServiceManager* and *SLFunctionManager* log file.

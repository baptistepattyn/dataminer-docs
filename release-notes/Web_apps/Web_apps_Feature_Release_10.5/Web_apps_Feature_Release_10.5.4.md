### Enhancements

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI component 'Dropdown' [ID 41838]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The UI component `UIBlockType.Dropdown` has been redesigned.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI component 'CheckBox' [ID 41891]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The UI component `UIBlockType.CheckBox` has been redesigned.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI component 'PasswordBox' [ID 42007]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The UI component `UIBlockType.PasswordBox` has been redesigned.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Read-only and/or disabled legacy UI components will be disabled when using URL argument '?useNewIASInputComponents=true' [ID 42009]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you add the following argument to the URL of a low-code app, all UI components that have not yet been redesigned will be disabled when they are set to read-only and/or disabled:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Low-Code Apps: Enhanced URL data support [ID 42031]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

Up to now, low-code apps would only support using URL data to pass default values to components. For example, to select a particular default value in a dropdown box. From now on, low-code apps will also be able to consume data passed via their URL using either the JSON syntax or the legacy syntax. For example, you will now be able to use an element specified in the URL to filter a GQI query.

For more information regarding the above-mentioned JSON syntax and legacy syntax, see [Specifying data input in a dashboard URL](xref:Specifying_data_input_in_a_dashboard_URL).

> [!NOTE]
> Contrary to dashboards, low-code apps will not push data to the URL. In other words, the URL will not change when data is selected in a component.

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI component 'RadioButtonList' [ID 42032]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The UI component `UIBlockType.RadioButtonList` has been redesigned.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Column & bar chart component: Settings now have new default values [ID 42106]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The following settings of a *Column & bar chart* component now have new default values:

| Setting | Old default | New default |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Chart layout      | Relative per variable | Absolute      |
| Chart orientation | Left to right         | Bottom to top |

Existing components will not be affected.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Reordering the columns in a Select operator by dragging and dropping [ID 42122]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In a *Select* operator of a GQI query, you can now reorder the columns by dragging and dropping them.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Query builder: Dragging and dropping operators [ID 42127]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When building a query, it is now possible to drag and drop operators from one location to another. However, this will only be allowed within the same level, not from e.g. a joined query to the parent query or vice versa.

If an operator shows a red error state after you have dragged it to a new location, this means that the operator in question cannot be used at that location and that the query has become invalid as a result.

Also, it is now possible to insert new operators in between existing ones by clicking a "+" button.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Grid component: Using browser menu commands [ID 42128]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

From now on, the *Grid* component will allow you to use browser menu commands. It will now be possible to e.g. select text in a *Grid* component and copy it to another application by means of the *Copy* command of your browser.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Time range component: Enhanced readability of Apply button [ID 42155]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In the *Time range* component, up to now, the color of the *Apply* button would, in some cases, be too close to the color of the component background. As a result, the text on the button would be barely readable.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Selected items will be passed from one component to another in the order in which they were selected [ID 42163]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

Items selected in *Node edge graph*, *Grid*, *Maps*, *Timeline* or *Table* components will now be passed to another components in the order in which they have been selected.

#### Dashboards app: Default Skyline dashboard themes have been updated [ID 42179]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In the following default Skyline dashboards themes, the colors have been updated:

- Skyline Light - White
- Skyline Light - Gray
- Skyline Dark

These new colors will be applied to all existing and new dashboards, as well as to all pages and panels of low-code apps that are using one of the above-mentioned themes.

#### Web Services API: Enhanced performance of the GetRegionalSettings method [ID 42202]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

Up to now, each time the *GetRegionalSettings* method was called, it would retrieve the time zone and the list separator from the *ClientSettings.json* file. From now on, it will only retrieve the time zone and list separator the first time it is called after an API connection was set up, and will cache that data for as long as the API connection is up and running.

> [!NOTE]
> As a result of this change, any changes made to the time zone and/or list separator in *ClientSettings.json* will no longer be applied when you refresh the web app. From now on, changes made to the time zone and/or list separator will require an IIS reset.

### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps: Certain actions would incorrectly not use the event information passed to them [ID 41979]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When the following actions were executed, up to now, they would incorrectly not use the event information that was passed to them.

- *Set viewport* action on a *Line & area chart* component with parameter data
- *Set value* action on a *Time range* component
- *Set value* action on a *Numeric input* component

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Table component: Problem when loading data from a partial table [ID 42107]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In some cases, when new data from a partial table was being loaded into a *Table* component, the loading would get stuck.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Grid component: Scroll bars would appear even though all items could be displayed [ID 42108]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In some cases, scroll bars would appear on a *Grid* component, even though there was sufficient screen real estate to display all items.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Letter descenders would incorrectly be cut off in Components data set [ID 42118]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When, while configuring a component, you opened the *Components* data set on the *Data* pane, all portions of letters that extended below the font's baseline (i.e. the descenders of letters like e.g. g, j, q, p, and y) would incorrectly be cut off.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Parameter table component: Clicking the info icon of the 'Parameter table filters' section would not open the correct help page [ID 42123]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When, while configuring a *Parameter table* component, you opened the *Parameter table filters*\* section on the *Data* pane and clicked the information icon on the right, the main page of [docs.dataminer.services](xref:docs_dataminer_services) would incorrectly be opened. From now on, the correct page, i.e. [Dynamic table filter syntax](xref:Dynamic_table_filter_syntax), will be opened instead.

\**The *Parameter table filters* section is only available if you add the `showAdvancedSettings=true` option to the URL of the dashboard or the low-code app.*

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Problem when deleting an operator from a flow [ID 42125]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you wanted to delete an operator in the flow editor, up to now, you incorrectly had to delete it twice before it got removed from the flow.

#### Low-Code Apps: Variables in a flow would not correctly push the latest value through the flow [ID 42133]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In some cases, variables merged with components inside a flow would not correctly push the latest value through the flow.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Time range component: Changing the 'Granularity' setting could produce an invalid time range [ID 42145]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you changed the *Granularity* setting of a *Time range* component from *Date & time* to *Date* or vice versa, in some cases, the specified time range would become invalid.

#### Web apps: About box would incorrectly no longer show any OEM information [ID 42190]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

The *About* box of the DataMiner web apps would incorrectly no longer show any OEM information. This information has now been added again.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Components would stop responding after trying to fetch non-existing objects [ID 42192]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When a component had tried to fetch a number of non-existing objects (e.g. elements, parameter, etc.), in some cases, it would stop responding.

#### Dashboards app: 'Link to data' popup would not contain any data when the query had a filter node linked to a variable or a flow [ID 42201]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When, after you had refreshed a dashboard, you opened a *Link to data* popup of an existing data link while configuring a query in which a filter node was linked to a variable or a flow, that popup would not contain any data.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Removing component data would incorrectly remove all data from the 'Components' section [ID 42216]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you removed the most recently added component data from a component, all data would be removed from the *Components* section of the *Data* pane, including the predefined component data.

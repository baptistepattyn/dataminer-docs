### Enhancements

#### Web visual overviews: Load balancing [ID 41434] [ID 41728]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU1]/10.6.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

It is now possible to implement load balancing among DataMiner Agents in a DMS for visual overviews shown in web apps.

Up to now, the DataMiner Agent to which you were connected would handle all requests and updates with regard to web visual overviews.

##### Configuration

In the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\API\\Web.config* file of a particular DataMiner Agent, add the following keys in the `<appSettings>` section:

- `<add key="visualOverviewLoadBalancer" value="true" />`

  Enables or disables load balancing on the DataMiner Agent in question.

  - When this key is set to **true**, for the DataMiner Agent in question, all requests and updates with regard to web visual overviews will by default be handled in a balanced manner by all the DataMiner Agents in the cluster.

    However, if you also add the `dmasForLoadBalancer` key (see below), these requests and updates will only be handled by the DataMiner Agents specified in that `dmasForLoadBalancer` key.

  - When this key is set to **false**, for the DataMiner Agent in question, all requests and updates with regard to web visual overviews will be handled by the local SLHelper process.

- `<add key="dmasForLoadBalancer" value="1;2;15" />`

  If you enabled load balancing by setting the `visualOverviewLoadBalancer` key to true, you can use this key to restrict the number of DataMiner Agents that will be used for visual overview load balancing.

  The key's value must be set to a semicolon-separated list of DMA IDs. For example, if the value is set to "1;2;15", the DataMiner Agents with ID 1, 2, and 15 will be used to handle all requests and updates with regard to web visual overviews.

  If you only specify one ID (without trailing semicolon), only that specific DataMiner Agent will be used to handle all requests and updates with regard to web visual overviews.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings are not synchronized among the Agents in the cluster.

##### New server messages

The following new messages can now be used to  which you can target to be sent to other DMAs in the cluster:

- `TargetedGetVisualOverviewDataMessage` allows you to retrieve a Visual Overview data message containing the image and the content of a visual overview.

- `TargetedSetVisualOverviewDataMessage` allows you to execute actions on a visual overview that is rendered on a specific DataMiner Agent.

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner Agents will now automatically detect that a visual overview they are rendering has been updated. This means that other agents in the cluster will now be able to correctly process update events and request new images for their clients.

##### Logging

Additional logging with regard to visual overview load balancing will be available in the web logs located in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\Web* folder.

#### Enhanced performance when updating subscriptions and when checking events against the set of active subscriptions [ID 41822]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when updating subscriptions and when checking events against the set of active subscriptions.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced handling of locked files when activating or deactivating functions [ID 41978]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the ProtocolFunctionManager with regard to the handling of locked files when activating or deactivating functions.

#### NATS: NatsCustodianResetNatsRequest will now be blocked when the NATSForceManualConfig option is enabled [ID 42074]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When the `NATSForceManualConfig` option is enabled in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, the `NatsCustodianResetNatsRequest` message will now be blocked. Instead of performing a NATS reset, it will now return an error with the following message:

`Resetting NATS is blocked while the system is running a Manual Config. See https://docs.dataminer.services/user-guide/Reference/DataMiner_Tools/SLNetClientTest_tool/SLNetClientTest_tool_advanced_procedures/SLNetClientTest_disabling_automatic_nats_config.html for more information.`

> [!NOTE]
> The `NatsCustodianResetNatsRequest` message will also be blocked when BrokerGateway is being used.

#### Security enhancements [ID 42104]

<!-- 42104: MR 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

### Fixes

#### Issue in SLNet could cause errors to be thrown in low-code apps [ID 40978]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.2 -->

Because of an issue in SLNet, after a restart of a DataMiner Agent, "not supported by the current server version" errors could get thrown in all low-code apps.

#### SLAnalytics: Memory leak due to an excessive number of messages being received following an alarm template update [ID 42047]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When an alarm template was updated, in some cases, the alarm focus manager could receive a excessive number of messages, causing SLAnalytics to leak memory.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Problem when trying to retrieve incorrect INF values from the database [ID 42069]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

In some cases, INF (infinity) values would incorrectly get stored in the database. Attempts to retrieve those values would then result in the *Behavioral anomaly detection* feature not starting up.

# Troubleshooting

For general Visual Studio troubleshooting information, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/welcome-visual-studio).

Below you can find more information on issues encountered while working with Visual Code and DIS, which are not related to DIS itself.

## A solution is missing in the Solution Explorer

When you have created a solution, it can occur that this solution is not displayed in the Solution Explorer.

In that case, close Visual Studio, open Windows Explorer, go to the folder containing the solution, and double-click the .sln file. This will start Visual Studio and automatically load the solution. The Solution Explorer should then list all files contained in the solution.

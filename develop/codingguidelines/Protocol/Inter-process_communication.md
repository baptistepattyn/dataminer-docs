# Inter-process communication

The number of interactions between SLScripting, the process executing the QAction, and other processes should be considered wisely, as these consume a considerable amount of resources. The number of interactions per second should also be limited.

It can occur that a QAction needs to perform an operation that requires some time to complete (e.g. a DMS call). In case another call is needed to determine if the operation has finished, you must avoid continuously repeating the call that checks the operation status without leaving time between the calls (for example, by including a Thread.Sleep call in the loop).

Typically, QActions mainly interact with the SLProtocol process using an instance of the SLProtocol (or SLProtocolExt) class. As each protocol object call results in inter-process communication between the SLScripting and SLProtocol processes, consider the following:

- Use bulk method calls (e.g. GetParameters, SetParameters, GetColumns, FillArray, etc) instead of many specific method calls (e.g. GetParameter, SetParameter, GetRow, GetParameterIndexByKey, etc) to get and set multiple parameters, respectively. This is not so much about reducing the number of calls to the absolute minimum but more about finding the right balance between readability/maintainability on the one side and performance on the other side, and about keeping things scalable. Examples:

  - Splitting the retrieval of several standalone parameters into 2 or 3 method calls for readability/maintainability reasons is absolutely fine. The number of method calls is still kept under control and will not grow as the data source scales up.

  - Splitting the retrieval of a whole table into many GetParameterIndexByKey method calls via a loop is not acceptable. As the data source will scale up, the number of method calls will also grow, eventually growing out of control.

- The implementation with the best performance should be used when retrieving or updating tables. A QAction implementation that retrieves or sets column(s) is generally preferred over a QAction that triggers on every row of a table (row=true).

- Protocol calls inside a loop should be avoided as much as possible.

- Grouping protocol calls into a single bulk one should be preferred, but only to some extent. More information, refer to the [guidelines for dealing with very large tables](xref:Data_handling#guidelines)

In order to improve readability (and type safety) of code in QActions, the following guidelines should be considered:

- In case a wrapper method is available for a NotifyProtocol call, the use of the wrapper method is favored.

- In legacy DataMiner versions, the use of the GetKeys method to retrieve the primary keys (NotifyProtocol.KeyType.Index) had to be avoided as this was based on the SLElement process, which could cause a delay that could result in returned data not being up to date. This is no longer the case in the currently supported DataMiner versions. However, note that obtaining the display keys (NotifyProtocol.KeyType.DisplayKey) is still based on SLElement.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The implementation of the Keys property of the QActionTable class also makes use of the GetKeys method.
> - The ClearAllKeys() method still uses the NT_GET_INDEXES call, so for this reason the use of this method should be avoided.
